Die Distanz bestimmt ob der Fahrer bequem und schmerzfrei \u00c3\u00bcber dem Fahrrad stehen kann. Falls die \u00c3\u009cberstandsh\u00c3\u00b6he zu klein ist, kann es beim Stehen \u00c3\u00bcber dem Fahrrad zu Problemen kommen, falls ein oder beide R\u00c3\u00a4der h\u00c3\u00b6her stehen als die F\u00c3\u00bc\u00c3\u009fe. Damit ist der Schritt dem Oberrohr n\u00c3\u00a4her. Dieser geringe Abstand ist insbesondere f\u00c3\u00bcr Mountainbiker ein Problem, da oft an unerwarteten Hindernissen angehalten werden muss und ein 'Aufsetzen' auf dem Oberrohr sehr schmerzhaft sein kann. Falls die \u00c3\u009cberstandsh\u00c3\u00b6he viel zu gro\u00c3\u009f ist, ist oftmals der Rahmen zu klein. Ein kleiner Rahmen is generell steifer als ein gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009ferer Rahmen, aber ein kleiner Rahmen ben\u00c3\u00b6tigt dann oftmals eine sehr weit herausgezogene Sattelst\u00c3\u00bctze um eine komfortable Sitzposition zu erm\u00c3\u00b6glichen. Weiterhin verringert sich bei einem kleinen Rahmen der Abstand zwischen Lenker und Tretlager (mit Fachausdruck 'Reach') If the standover height is too small then you can get into problems standing above your bike if one of he wheel is higher than your feet. This is especially important for off-road bikers, as it is often necessary to stop at an unexpected obstacle and colliding with the top tube might be very painful. If the standover height is much to big, it could be that the frame is too small for your body dimensions. A small frame is usually stiffer, but to be able to sit comfortably, the seat post would have to be extended very far. After entering your body measures and your frame dimensions you can instantly see the standover height drawn right into the cycle ! The standover height is drawn in red and the length is shown in cm (or inches) in the rectangle above. You can change your standing position above the bike with the slider in the Rectangle. This can be useful if your bike frame has a very sloping top tube like many modern mountain bikes (e.g. downhill bikes). These bikes use a sloping top tube to provide the rider with more clearance on jumps and bumps to avoid collisions with the top tube.","tags":"","url":"de\/U\u0308berstandsho\u0308he.html"},{"title":"English","text":"VisualCycle Overview Who benefits from using VisualCycle ? What VisualCycle can do for you: Features of VisualCycle ScreenShots Insert your own body measures Main Menu Submenus VisualCycle Overview Are you in the market for a custom frame and are afraid of choosing the wrong size ? Worry no more, just use VisualCycle to simulate your dream bike or your custom frame. VisualCycle is a stunning visual simulation of a custom cycle with you as the rider. All the relevant details are lovingly animated and of course, you can decide on all the frame dimensions and set your own body measures. VisualCycle can also help you to to decide if that rare cycle on auction is fitting you. Who benefits from using VisualCycle ? Anyone who wants to buy a cycle or cycle frame which can not be tried and tested. This would include: custom frames build according to a customers unique body measures. bikes sold only on the internet used bikes on auction What VisualCycle can do for you: VisualCycle currently does simulate a rigid Mountainbike (MTB) with a diamond frame together with the detailed rider.As a suspension fork in essence just adds a certain amount of sag (let`s say something like 15%), a suspension fork can be easily simulated by reducing the height of the fork stanchions. A full suspension bike (fully) can not be simulated with the current version of VisualCycle, but it is planned for a future version. Features of VisualCycle gorgeous visual simulation of a cycle together with you as a rider. insert your body measures into the simulation. find fitting saddle height and horizontal saddle position. change any frame parameter and watch the changes being instantly applied to the simulation. check on stand-over-height for any new frame dimension. touch and try the cycle, move limbs and cycle parts. extensive display of cycle measures, tube names and angles. ScreenShots Insert your own body measures You can enter your own body dimensions directly into the simulation. VisualCycle can use these body dimensions to check against certain parameters of the simulated bike frame, like standover height, saddle height etc. Main Menu Above: Screenshot of the main menu of VisualCycle. The above screenshot shows the central point of access for VisualCycle. All functionality can be accessed in one of the submenus or with the Menu button at the top right.

Loading body dimensions: Loading the body dimensions from the simulation can be use to change a previously saved VisualCycle simulation. Entering new values: When entering new body dimensions you can choose your gender and then you can load the standart values for a given body height. That way you have an easy reference if the values you want to input are reasonably close to the standart values. The software will guide you through the input procedure and will alert you to value which are out of bounds. At the end of the setup procedure you can send the new body measures to the simulation to be animated and displayed.","tags":"","url":"en\/Body_Measure.html"},{"title":"Cycle Measure","text":"Cycle measures submenu: Overview Frame tube: Other cycle measures: Frame angles: Documentation: Cycle measures submenu: Overview The Cycle measures submenu consists of 5 different parts, which are explaining in detail the different measures of your cycle.
